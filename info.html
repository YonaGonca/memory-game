                        <li>If you find a pair, the cards are removed from the game, and you earn a point. If they don't match, the cards are flipped back. Remember the flipped cards to try matching them later.</li>

                    <p>Memory games have an ancient origin, with records of early versions being played in ancient Egypt, China, and India. The modern game, as we know it today, was popularized in Europe in the 19th century, especially in Germany, where it appeared in children's activity books. Since then, it has become a popular pastime and an educational tool worldwide.</p>
